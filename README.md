# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created as prework to get myself ready for the start of coding bootcamp. I completd the prework to ensure I am as prepared as possible for the start of the course. It was helpful to see some of the basics in action and learn a few coding commands. I found the visual component - while rudimentary - very useful becuase I could follow changes I was making in the code and how they affected the live view of the webpage we were building.

Each section of the study guide will contain notes about the various languages we'll be working with during the bootcamp, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as notes about Git. It will list the topics we've learned from prework and can randomly choose one for us to study.
